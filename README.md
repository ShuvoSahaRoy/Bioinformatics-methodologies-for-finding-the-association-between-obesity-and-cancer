### Abstract: 
Obesity is a complex, multifactorial disease that’s strongly related to multiple comorbidities. 
Several types of cancer, diabetes mellitus, gallbladder disease, cardiovascular disease, disability,
osteoarthritis, hypertension, and stroke, experts consider these diseases as comorbidities of Obesity.
But nowadays, the Obesity–cancer link has received much concentration. It causes several types of cancer 
including colon, breast, endometrium, liver, kidney, gallbladder, leukemia, lung, pancreatic and poorer
treatment and increased cancer-related mortality can be caused by it. Bioinformatics approaches like 
gene set enrichment analysis and semantic similarity can help in evaluating the interconnection among
Obesity and all types of cancer. We first performed a detailed survey of gene expression data available 
in public repositories on Obesity and less commonly considered cancer. Then we designed a pipeline that
integrates gene expression, cell type data and online resources using bioinformatics methods such as gene 
set enrichment analysis and semantic similarity. R language is used to design this pipeline and available 
at GitHub. Using this pipeline we found differential expressed genes, gene ontology terms and pathway among
Obesity and different types of cancer and therefore the closeness among the chosen pathologies by means
of disease ontology terms. Physicians and other researchers like molecular biologists, systems biologists
and pharmacologists can use it to analyze pathology in detail from differential expressed genes to 
ontologies, performing a comparison with the pathology comorbidities or with other diseases. <br/>
Keywords: Comorbidity, pathology, obesity, cancer, ontologies, gene set enrichment analysis, semantic similarity.
